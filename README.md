# MipsSimulator
Pipelined MIP datapath simulator

Project	Overview:	
The	goal of this project	is to implement	a	low-­level cycle-­accurate pipelined MIPS	datapath simulator.Simulating 
the	datapath includes simulating all of its storage components (register file,memories,and pipeline registers)and	all
of its control signals.This	document details the supported instructions,the inputs to	the	simulator,and	the	expected 
outputs.

ISA:
  •Arithmetic:add, addi, sub
  •Load/Store:lw, sw
  •Logic:sll, srl, and, andi, or, ori, nor
  •Control flow:beq, bne, j, jal, jr
  •Comparison:slt, sltu
